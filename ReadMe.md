# This is an Ananlysis Carried out on my LinkedIn Profile Connections.

**Date of Data Collection:** 11th August, 2022 at 08:43hr (WAT)

**Data Source:** https://www.linkedin.com/

## Summary:

The data was gotten directly from my LinkedIn account on the above mentioned date. The .csv file downloaded had a shape of (723, 6) implying that at the time of data collection, I had a total of 723 connections. After data cleaning, I enged working with only 674 of my connections.

I used the NetworkX Python package to create the network graph and the Pyvis network to the graph and make it interactive.

## Conclusion:

**Insight 1:** 9 of my connections have no names. This is strange. 

**Insight 2:** A good majority of my connections didn't include their email addresses on their profile. Not encouraged.

**Question:** How could there be connections with no names? Could those represent deleted accouunts?

**Insight 3:** I joined LinkedIn in 2015. This was first year in Covenant University. I believe it had something to do with the inspirational people I met in the Technical Crew service Unit.

**Insight 4:** First spike of connection activity in 2018. This should be because I was trying to get an internship ooportunity around that time.

**Insight 5:** Second spike of connection activity in 2020. Convocation and job search.

**Insight 6:** Third spike of connection activity, 2022. Job search and connection to learn more and add value to myself and those I connect with.

**Insight 7:** Most of my connections are from Covenant University. Makes sense as I spent 5 years of my life interacting wth these people and that community was a major force for my joining and being active on LinkedIn.
